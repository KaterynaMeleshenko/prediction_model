Regression on the tabular data. General Machine Learning

You have a dataset (train.csv) that contains 53 anonymized features and a target
column. Your task is to build a model that predicts a target based on the proposed
features. Please provide predictions for the hidden_test.csv file. Target metric is RMSE.

The main goal is to provide github repository that contains:

● jupyter notebook with exploratory data analysis;
● train.py python script for model training;
● predict.py python script for model inference on test data;
● file with prediction results;
● readme file that contains instructions about project setup and general guidance
around project;
● requirements.txt file.

Please provide documented code. Scripts (train.py and predict.py) should be able
to be executed from the terminal.
